  \multirow{12}{1em}{\rotatebox{90}{\normalsize{Curating}}} &  Missing/Repeated Records & Aggregates might become inaccurate, impeding all comparisons \\
&  Outliers & Aggregates might become inaccurate, impeding all comparisons \\
&  Incorrectly assumed high Quality data &  \\
&  Multiple comparisons problem &  \cite{pu2018garden, zgraggen2018investigating}\\

&  Insufficient data &  \\
&  * &  \cite{kim2003taxonomy}\\
&  Numeric outliers &  \cite{wang2019uni}\\
&  Spelling mistakes & Differently spelled groups might fall into different aggregates, causing inaccurate comparisons \cite{wang2019uni}\\
&  Uniqueness constraint failure & Marks assumed to represent single values might represent several (which may then be further skewed by aggregates like SUM) \cite{wang2019uni}\\
&  unidentified functional dependencies & Visualization might show a strong relationship between variables, when in fact that relationship is part of the data composition (eg A+B = C, plot A vs C) \\
&  Drill-down bias & Apparent trends might be attributed to the more specific/recently specified filters rather than relatively "simpler" explanations \cite{lee2019avoiding}\\

& \rowcolor{Gray} High variability or noise in contrast to the effect size & Irrelevant conclusions could be made \\
& \rowcolor{Gray} P-hacking & Gives the impression of an non-extant correlation \\
& \rowcolor{Gray} Outliers combined with the wrong aggregation type. &  \\
& \rowcolor{Gray} Aggregates mask second order statistics & Two things may appear to be equal when in fact their distributions are fundamentally different \cite{matejka2017same, few2019loom}\\

& \rowcolor{Gray} Inappropriate use of mean & Mean comparisons with normal distribution will be skewed \cite{few2019loom}\\
& \rowcolor{Gray} Confusing imputation & Imputation that generates zeroes rather removing rows can radically alter aggregates \cite{song2018s}\\
& \rowcolor{Gray} Sampling at a rate less than the nyquist rate & Apparent trend will be the aliases rather than the signal \\
  \multirow{28}{1em}{\rotatebox{90}{\normalsize{Visualizing}}} &  Banking to 45 failure & Trend can appear from flat data or vice-versa \\
&  area/length mismatches &  Correll YAxis truncation paper?\\

&  Time not aligned in direction of language &  \\
&  Overplotting &  \\
&  Singularities &  \cite{kindlmann2014algebraic}\\
&  Improper Layering & Overplotting can cause an non-existent trend to emerge from draw order \cite{kindlmann2014algebraic}\\
&  Latent variables Missing &  \\
&  Wrong/missing aggregation & Aggregate marks with no opacity overlapping each other do an implicit max \\
&  Flipped & Trend understood to be opposite \cite{pandey2015deceptive, correll2017black, cleveland1982variables}\\
&  Scale extents larger than the range of the data & Differences compressed and visual variability is removed \cite{cleveland1982variables}\\
&  Distortions (log scales, say) and non-linearities & Can cause readers to inaccurately correlate variables and cluster values \\
&  Truncated/expanded axes & Can cause sorting errors and errors in characterizing distribution \cite{pandey2015deceptive, correll2017black, cleveland1982variables}\\
&  Colors binned unevenly &  \\
&  Color just showing base rate & Mistake base rate for data signal rate \cite{correll2016surprise}\\
&  Semantically color scale not relevant  & Reader may misinterpret color on a map as indicating the content of that region rather than a data variable \\
&  Within-bar-bias &  \cite{newman2012bar}\\
&  Highlight/downplaying outliers &  \\
&  Clipped outliers & Chosen domain hides outliers, impending extrema detection \\
&  Continuous marks describe nominal quantities &  \cite{mcnuttlinting}\\
